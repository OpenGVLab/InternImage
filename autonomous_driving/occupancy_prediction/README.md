## InternImage-based Baseline for CVPR23 Occupancy Prediction Challenge!!!!

We improve our baseline with a more powerful image backbone: **InaternImage**, which shows its excellent ability within a series of leaderboards and benchmarks, such as *COCO* and *nuScenes*.


#### openmmlab packages requirements
```bash
torch==1.12 # recommend
mmcv-full>=1.5.0
mmdet==2.24.0
mmsegmentation==0.24.0
timm
numpy==1.22
```

### Install DCNv3 for InternImage
```bash
cd projects/mmdet3d_plugin/bevformer/backbones/ops_dcnv3

## Introduction
Understanding the 3D surroundings including the background stuffs and foreground objects is important for autonomous driving. In the traditional 3D object detection task, a foreground object is represented by the 3D bounding box. However, the geometrical shape of the object is complex, which can not be represented by a simple 3D box, and the perception of the background is absent. The goal of this task is to predict the 3D occupancy of the scene. In this task, we provide a large-scale occupancy benchmark based on the nuScenes dataset. The benchmark is a voxelized representation of the 3D space, and the occupancy state and semantics of the voxel in 3D space are jointly estimated in this task. The complexity of this task lies in the dense prediction of 3D space given the surround-view image.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Task Definition
Given images from multiple cameras, the goal is to predict the current occupancy state and semantics of each voxel grid in the scene. The voxel state is predicted to be either free or occupied. If a voxel is occupied, its semantic class needs to be predicted, as well. Besides, we also provide a binary observed/unobserved mask for each frame. An observed voxel is defined as an invisible grid in the current camera observation, which is ignored in the evaluation stage.

### Rules for Occupancy Challenge
* We allow using annotations provided in the nuScenes dataset, and during inference, the input modality of the model should be camera only. 
* Other public/private datasets are not allowed in the challenge in any form (except ImageNet or MS-COCO pre-trained image backbone). 
* No future frame is allowed during inference.
* In order to check the compliance, we will ask the participants to provide technical reports to the challenge committee and the participant will be asked to provide a public talk about the method after winning the award.

## Evaluation Metrics
Leaderboard ranking for this challenge is by the intersection-over-union (mIoU) over all classes. 
### mIoU

Let $C$ be he number of classes. 

$$
    mIoU=\frac{1}{C}\displaystyle \sum_{c=1}^{C}\frac{TP_c}{TP_c+FP_c+FN_c},
$$

where $TP_c$ , $FP_c$ , and $FN_c$ correspond to the number of true positive, false positive, and false negative predictions for class $c_i$.

### F-Score
We also measure the F-score as the harmonic mean of the completeness $P_c$ and the accuracy $P_a$.

$$
    F-score=\left( \frac{P_a^{-1}+P_c^{-1}}{2} \right) ^{-1} ,
$$

where $P_a$ is the percentage of predicted voxels that are within a distance threshold to the ground truth voxels, and $P_c$ is the percentage of ground truth voxels that are within a distance threshold to the predicted voxels.

- The dataset contains 18 classes. The definition of classes from 0 to 16 is the same as the [nuScenes-lidarseg](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/blob/fcc41628d41060b3c1a86928751e5a571d2fc2fa/python-sdk/nuscenes/eval/lidarseg/README.md) dataset. The label 17 category represents voxels that are not occupied by anything, which is named as `free`. Voxel semantics for each sample frame is given as `[semantics]` in the labels.npz. 

- <strong>How are the labels annotated?</strong> The ground truth labels of occupancy derive from accumulative LiDAR scans with human annotations. 
  - If a voxel reflects a LiDAR point, then it is assigned as the same semantic label as the LiDAR point;
  - If a LiDAR beam passes through a voxel in the air, the voxel is set to be `free`;
  - Otherwise, we set the voxel to be unknown, or unobserved. This happens due to the sparsity of the LiDAR or the voxel is occluded, e.g. by a wall. In the dataset, `[mask_lidar]` is a 0-1 binary mask, where 0's represent unobserved voxels. As shown in Fig.1(b), grey voxels are unobserved. Due to the limitation of the visualization tool, we only show unobserved voxels at the same height as the ground. 

- <strong>Camera visibility.</strong> Note that the installation positions of LiDAR and cameras are different, therefore, some observed voxels in the  LiDAR view are not seen by the cameras. Since we focus on a vision-centric task, we provide a binary voxel mask `[mask_camera]`, indicating whether the voxels are observed or not in the current camera view. As shown in Fig.1(c), white voxels are observed in the accumulative LiDAR view but unobserved in the current camera view.

- Both `[mask_lidar]` and `[mask_camera]` masks are optional for training. Participants do not need to predict the masks. Only `[mask_camera]` is used for evaluation; the unobserved voxels are not involved during calculating the F-score and mIoU.

### Known Issues
- Nuscene ([issues-721](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/issues/721)) lacks translation in the z-axis, which makes it hard to recover accurate 6d localization and would lead to the misalignment of point clouds while accumulating them over whole scenes. Ground stratification occurs in several data.
